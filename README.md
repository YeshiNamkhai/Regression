# Regression

This is an implementation of *Simple Linear Regression* reading an input file in CSV format such as

| Age | Height |
| --- | --- |
| 4 | 100.1 |
| 5 | 107.2 |
| 6 | 114.1 |
| 7 | 121.7 |
| 8 | 126.8 |
| 9 | 130.9 |
| 10 | 137.5 |
| 11 | 143.2 |
| 12 | 149.4 |
| 13 | 151.6 |
| 14 | 154.0 |
| 15 | 154.6 |
| 16 | 155.0 |
| 17 | 155.1 |
| 18 | 155.3 |
| 19 | 155.7 |

..and showing a dispersion plot to check whether is meaningful to look for an equation in the form **y=ax+b**. 

<small>Where the variable **y** is indipendent and the variable  **x** is dipendent. In this equation the coefficent **a** is the regression and as usual gives the slope of the line.</small>
